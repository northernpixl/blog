                cat: "Landscape", 
                fundamentals: "Hyperfocal distance is the mathematical calculation for maximum depth of field. It defines the closest distance at which a lens can be focused while keeping objects at 'infinity' acceptably sharp. When you focus at the hyperfocal distance, your depth of field extends from exactly half that distance all the way to the horizon. \n\nWHY IT MATTERS: In landscape photography, you often have a foreground element (like rocks or flowers) and a background element (like a castle or mountain). If you focus on the horizon, your foreground will be soft. If you focus on the rocks, the castle will be blurry. Hyperfocal is the only way to get both sharp in a single frame without focus stacking.\n\nDETAILED STEPS:\n1. Compose your shot.\n2. Determine your focal length (e.g., 24mm) and aperture (e.g., f/11).\n3. Use an app (PhotoPills) to find the hyperfocal distance number (e.g., 1.7 meters).\n4. Switch your lens to Manual Focus.\n5. Focus on an object roughly 1.7m away (or use the distance scale on the lens).\n6. Verify: Check that the distant horizon is sharp. If it's slightly soft, nudge focus slightly further away.", 
                impact: "Maximizing sharpness across the entire frame creates a professional, immersive feel. It guides the viewer's eye from the grass at their feet to the clouds in the sky without hitting any blurry 'dead zones'.", 
                proTip: "No app? The 'Double Distance' rule works well: Estimate how far away your closest subject is (e.g., 2 meters). Focus at double that distance (4 meters). Check your review screen and zoom in to verify."

                fundamentals: "Long exposure involves using a slow shutter speed to blur the movement of water or clouds. In Northumberland, this is the signature style for coastlines. \n\nGEAR NEEDED:\n1. A sturdy tripod (essential; hand-holding is impossible).\n2. A remote shutter release (to prevent shake when pressing the button).\n3. Neutral Density (ND) filters: A 6-stop (Little Stopper) for low light or a 10-stop (Big Stopper) for bright sun.\n\nSETTINGS GUIDE:\n- 0.5 to 1 second: Retains texture and energy in the water (good for crashing waves and 'streaks').\n- 30 seconds: Creates a flat, misty, ethereal surface (good for calm minimalism).\n- 2 minutes+: Totally flattens the sea and streaks the clouds into ribbons.",

                fundamentals: "Composition is the arrangement of elements. The Rule of Thirds divides the frame into a 3x3 grid using two horizontal and two vertical lines. \n\nAPPLICATION:\n- Horizon: Place it on the top line to emphasize the foreground (rocks/beach). Place it on the bottom line to emphasize a dramatic sky.\n- Intersections: Place your main subject (e.g., a castle) where the grid lines cross (the 'power points').\n\nADVANCED CONCEPTS:\n- Leading Lines: Use the pier at Blyth or a wall at Housesteads to physically point towards your subject.\n- Negative Space: Don't be afraid of empty sky. It creates a sense of scale and isolation.", 
                impact: "Good composition transforms a snapshot into a story. It creates balance and tension, guiding the viewer through the image in a deliberate way rather than letting their eye wander aimlessly.", 
                proTip: "Break the rule for symmetry! If you're shooting the Blyth Beach Huts or a reflection in a still lake, center the horizon perfectly to emphasize the geometric mirror effect."

                fundamentals: "Sometimes, physics defeats you. Even at f/16, you cannot get a flower 10cm from the lens and a mountain 10km away both sharp. Focus stacking solves this by combining multiple images focused at different distances.\n\nFIELD WORKFLOW:\n1. Lock your camera on a tripod. Composition must not change.\n2. Exposure: Manual mode (constant aperture/shutter/ISO).\n3. Shot 1: Focus on the absolute closest object.\n4. Shot 2: Focus on the middle ground.\n5. Shot 3: Focus on the background/infinity.\n6. Check: Ensure images overlap in focus zones.\n\nPOST-PROCESSING: Use Photoshop (Edit > Auto-Align, then Edit > Auto-Blend) or Helicon Focus to stitch them.", 
                impact: "This allows you to use the 'sweet spot' of your lens (usually f/5.6 or f/8) where it is sharpest, rather than stopping down to f/22 and suffering from diffraction blur (softness caused by light bending).", 
                proTip: "Watch out for wind! If the grass in the foreground moves between shot 1 and shot 2, the blending software will fail. Wait for a lull in the breeze."

                fundamentals: "A Circular Polarizer (CPL) is the one filter that software cannot mimic. It physically filters out scattered light waves coming from specific angles.\n\nPRIMARY USES:\n1. Removing Glare: It lets you see *through* the water in rock pools, revealing colored pebbles instead of white sky reflection.\n2. Darkening Skies: It deepens the blue of the sky, making white clouds pop.\n3. Foliage: It removes the white sheen from wet leaves in forests (like Cragside), increasing color saturation.\n\nHOW TO USE: Screw it on and rotate the outer ring while looking through the viewfinder. The effect will cycle from min to max.", 
                impact: "It adds 'punch' and clarity to images instantly. It turns a flat, hazy image into a vibrant, three-dimensional scene with rich contrast.", 
                proTip: "The '90-Degree Rule': Polarizers work best when the sun is at a 90-degree angle to your lens (i.e., over your shoulder). If shooting directly into the sun, they do nothing."

Find 'Auto Exposure Bracketing' in your menu.\n2. Set it to 3 shots with a 2-stop interval (-2, 0, +2).\n3. Set drive mode to 'High Speed Continuous'.\n4. Hold the button: The camera will take 3 rapid fire shots.\n- Shot 1 (Dark): Captures details in the bright sun/clouds.\n- Shot 2 (Normal): General exposure.\n- Shot 3 (Bright): Captures details in the deep shadows.", 
                impact: "Ensures you never have 'blown out' white skies or 'crushed' black shadows. You can merge these later into an HDR image or manually blend them for a natural look.", 
                proTip: "Even if you don't plan to blend them, shooting brackets is great 'insurance'. Sometimes the -2 underexposed shot is actually the moody, dramatic one you end up using."

                fundamentals: "The LCD screen on your camera lies—its brightness depends on the ambient light and screen settings. The Histogram is the only true mathematical representation of exposure.\n\nHOW TO READ IT:\n- The Graph: Represents pixels. Height = quantity.\n- Left Side: Shadow data (Blacks).\n- Right Side: Highlight data (Whites).\n- Middle: Midtones.\n- The Goal: Generally a 'bell curve' in the middle. \n- WARNING: If the graph hits the right wall ('clipping'), your white clouds are blown out and unrecoverable. If it hits the left wall, your shadows are dead black.", 
                impact: "Mastering the histogram ensures you capture all the data in the scene. It prevents you from getting home and realizing your sky is just a white blob.", 
                proTip: "Expose to the Right (ETTR). Push the graph as far right as possible without touching the wall. This gathers maximum light and reduces noise in the shadows when you darken it later."

The light is warm (orange/gold), soft, and directional, creating long shadows and texture. Best for: Dunes, beaches, rolling hills.\n\nBLUE HOUR: The hour before sunrise and after sunset. The sun is below the horizon. The light is cool (blue/magenta), shadowless, and soft. It balances perfectly with city lights or warm window glows.", 
                impact: "Shooting at noon (harsh white light) makes landscapes look flat. Shooting at the edges of the day adds emotion, color contrast, and three-dimensionality.", 
                proTip: "Don't pack up when the sun sets! The best color in the sky often happens 20 minutes AFTER sunset during the 'civil twilight' phase."

                fundamentals: "A tripod isn't just a stand; it's an anchor. Misusing it causes blurry long exposures, especially in wind.\n\nPROTOCOL:\n1. Turn off Image Stabilization (IS/VR): If the camera is on a tripod, IS systems can get confused by the lack of movement and create shake.\n2. Extend legs from the top down: The thicker leg sections are more stable.\n3. Use the hook: Hang your camera bag on the center column hook to add mass and dampen vibrations.\n4. Avoid the center column: Raising the center column is like putting your camera on a monopod—it wobbles.",

                cat: "Landscape", 
                fundamentals: "Beginners often think 'f/22 = maximum sharpness'. This is false physics. When you close the aperture hole too small, light waves bend (diffract) around the edges of the diaphragm blades, interfering with each other and causing the entire image to become soft.\n\nTHE SWEET SPOT: Most lenses are sharpest between f/8 and f/11. Beyond f/16, you are losing resolution significantly.\n\nSOLUTION: If you need more depth of field than f/11 provides, use 'Focus Stacking' instead of stopping down to f/22.", 
                impact: "Understanding diffraction prevents you from taking photos that look sharp on the LCD but soft and fuzzy on a computer monitor.", 
                proTip: "Test your lens! Put your camera on a tripod and shoot a detailed wall at f/8, f/11, f/16, and f/22. Zoom in on a computer to see exactly where softness begins."

                cat: "Landscape", 
                fundamentals: "A JPEG is a finished cake. A RAW file is the ingredients.\n\nJPEG: The camera processes the image (adds contrast, saturation, sharpening) and throws away the unused data to save space. You cannot easily change the white balance or recover shadows later.\n\nRAW: It saves all the data directly from the sensor. It looks flat and grey initially, but it holds massive amounts of hidden detail in the highlights and shadows. It requires 'developing' in software like Lightroom.", 
                impact: "Shooting RAW allows you to recover a sky that looks white or a shadow that looks black. It gives you the dynamic range needed for high-quality landscape printing.", 
                proTip: "Shoot 'RAW + JPEG'. This gives you a finished image to share on your phone immediately via Wi-Fi, but keeps the RAW file safe for your main edit later."

A Graduated Neutral Density (Grad ND) filter is a piece of glass that is dark at the top and clear at the bottom.\n\nTYPES:\n- Soft Edge: The transition from dark to clear is gradual. Use for uneven horizons (mountains, trees).\n- Hard Edge: The transition is abrupt. Use for flat horizons (sea).\n- Reverse Grad: Darkest in the middle, lighter at the top. Specifically for sunsets where the sun is on the horizon.",

It is caused by the lens failing to focus all colors of light at the exact same point.\n\nTHE FIX:\n1. In Camera: Many modern cameras have 'Lens Correction' built-in for JPEGs.\n2. Lightroom: In the 'Lens Corrections' panel, simply check 'Remove Chromatic Aberration'. This fixes 90% of cases.\n3. Manual: If the auto checkbox fails, use the 'Defringe' eyedropper tool to sample the purple color and desaturate it.",

It reveals the location to predators (crows/foxes) and can cause parents to abandon eggs.\n3. Baiting: Never use live bait. It alters natural hunting behaviors.\n4.

(e.g. 500/24mm = 20s). Pros: Easy math. Cons: Fails on high-resolution modern sensors, leaving trails.\n\n2. THE NPF RULE (The Gold Standard): Considers aperture, pixel density, and declination. It is much stricter (e.g., might suggest 13s for that same lens). \n\nVERDICT: Use the 500 Rule for Instagram/Phone viewing. Use the NPF Rule (via PhotoPills app) for large prints.",
