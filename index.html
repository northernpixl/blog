                fundamentals: "Aperture: Think of this as the size of the lens opening. Use a wide aperture (f/2.8) to let in more light and isolate your subject with a blurred background. Use a narrow aperture (f/11-f/16) for landscape shots where you want front-to-back sharpness.\n\nShutter Speed: This dictates how long the sensor is exposed. For crisp wildlife shots, use 1/1000s or faster. To blur water at Linhope Spout, use 1/2s or slower.\n\nISO: This is the sensor's sensitivity. Always keep it as low as possible (ISO 100) to avoid 'noise'. Only increase it when light is scarce and you cannot slow your shutter further.",
                impact: "Mastering this triangle allows you to control the 'mood' of a photo. It is the difference between a flat, accidental snapshot and a purposeful, artistic image where focus and motion are used as storytelling tools.",
                proTip: "If you change your Aperture by one 'stop', you must change either Shutter Speed or ISO by one 'stop' in the opposite direction to maintain the same brightness."

Tripod Discipline: Your tripod must be perfectly stable. If shooting on sand, push the legs deep into the wet surface until they stop moving. Hang your camera bag from the center column to add weight.\n\n3. Manual Focus: AF often fails through dark ND filters. Focus your shot before attaching the filter, then switch to Manual Focus to 'lock' it.",
                impact: "Long exposure reveals the passage of time. It simplifies complex coastal scenes by smoothing out chaotic waves and moving clouds, creating a minimalist and serene aesthetic.",
                proTip: "Always use a remote shutter release or the camera's built-in 2-second timer. The physical act of pressing the button with your finger causes 'micro-shake' which ruins sharpness."

Horizon Placement: For dramatic Northumberland skies, place the horizon on the bottom horizontal line. To emphasize the foreground rocks at Bamburgh, place it on the top line.\n\n2. Subject Alignment: Place your main point of interest (like a lighthouse) at the intersection points of these lines rather than the center.\n\n3. Leading Into Frame: If a subject is moving, leave more space in front of them than behind them to give them 'room to move'.",
                impact: "The Rule of Thirds mimics how the human eye naturally scans an image. It creates a balanced yet dynamic composition that feels energetic rather than static.",

Live View Magnification: Turn on your screen, find the brightest star, and use the digital zoom button (not the lens zoom) to magnify that star by 10x on your screen. \n\n3. Fine Adjustment: Gently rotate the focus ring until the star is the smallest possible point of light. If it looks like a bokeh 'donut', you are out of focus.\n\n4. Tape the Lens: Once sharp, use a small piece of electrical tape to lock the focus ring.",
                impact: "In Astro-photography, there is no 'good enough'. A star is either a pin-prick of light or a blurry mess. Precise focus allows the camera to capture the true color and intensity of distant galaxies.",

For Deer: They are larger and move slower. 1/800s is usually enough to freeze a walk. \n\n3. Auto-ISO: Pair Shutter Priority with Auto-ISO. This ensures that as the light changes (cloud cover), your shutter speed stays fast and the camera simply adjusts sensitivity to compensate.",
                impact: "Motion blur is the number one killer of wildlife photos. Prioritizing shutter speed ensures you capture the micro-details of feathers or fur that are lost if the animal is moving.",

Always respect 'Private Land' and 'No Entry' signage.",
