            { id: 1, title: "The Exposure Triangle", cat: "Basics", time: "12 min", content: "Mastering the relationship between Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO is the single most important skill for any photographer. Aperture controls depth of field (the blur in your background), Shutter Speed controls how motion is captured (freezing a bird in flight vs blurring a waterfall), and ISO controls the sensor's sensitivity to light. In the variable weather of Northumberland, you must learn to balance these three instinctively. For example, at Bamburgh, you might want a small aperture (f/11) for sharpness throughout the castle, but this requires a slower shutter speed, necessitating a tripod." },
            { id: 2, title: "Long Exposure Mastery", cat: "Technique", time: "15 min", content: "To get those professional, silky-smooth water effects at St Mary's Lighthouse, you need to leave your shutter open for a long time—usually between 10 and 30 seconds. This guide covers the use of ND (Neutral Density) filters, which act like sunglasses for your lens, allowing you to use long shutters even in bright daylight. We also discuss why a sturdy tripod and a remote shutter release are non-negotiable to prevent 'camera shake' which ruins the sharpness of the land while the water blurs." },
            { id: 3, title: "Composition: Rule of Thirds", cat: "Art", time: "10 min", content: "Don't just put your subject in the middle. The Rule of Thirds involves mentaly dividing your frame into a 3x3 grid. By placing the horizon on the bottom third line and the castle on one of the vertical intersections, you create a much more balanced and interesting image. This guide also explores 'Leading Lines'—using the cracks in the rocks or the shoreline to point the viewer's eye directly toward your main subject." },
            { id: 4, title: "Astro: Focusing in the Dark", cat: "Astro", time: "11 min", content: "Your camera's autofocus will fail at Kielder Observatory because it's too dark. To get sharp stars, you must use Manual Focus. Turn on 'Live View' on your screen, find the brightest star you can see, zoom in digitally on your screen, and slowly turn the focus ring until the star is a tiny, sharp pin-prick of light. Even a millimeter of movement can make the difference between a masterpiece and a blurry mess." },
            { id: 5, title: "Wildlife: Shutter Priority", cat: "Wildlife", time: "13 min", content: "When photographing Puffins at the Farne Islands, they move incredibly fast. You should use 'Shutter Priority' mode (S or Tv on your dial) and set it to at least 1/2000th of a second. This ensures that even the fast-flapping wings of the birds are frozen in time. We also cover 'Continuous Autofocus' (AI-Servo), which tells your camera to keep refocusing as the bird flies toward you." },
            { id: 6, title: "Understanding the Histogram", cat: "Tools", time: "10 min", content: "Your screen can lie to you in bright sunlight, but the histogram never does. This little graph shows you the distribution of light in your image. If the graph is touching the far right, you are 'blowing out' your highlights (losing detail in the clouds). If it's touching the left, your shadows are 'crushed' (pure black). Learn how to read this to ensure you have the 'perfect' exposure every time you click the shutter." },
            { id: 7, title: "The Power of RAW Files", cat: "Tools", time: "10 min", content: "A JPEG is a finished meal; a RAW file is the ingredients. Shooting in RAW captures every bit of data your sensor can see. In the high-contrast light of a Northumberland sunset, RAW allows you to 'recover' the dark shadows and bright highlights in editing software like Lightroom later, giving you professional results that JPEGs simply cannot match." },
            { id: 8, title: "Golden Hour vs Blue Hour", cat: "Landscape", time: "12 min", content: "Timing is everything. Golden Hour (the hour after sunrise/before sunset) provides warm, soft light that makes the stone of Dunstanburgh Castle glow. Blue Hour (the hour before sunrise/after sunset) provides a deep, moody atmosphere perfect for cityscapes or coastal shots. We teach you how to plan your day around these two critical windows." },
            { id: 9, title: "White Balance Basics", cat: "Basics", time: "10 min", content: "Ever wonder why your snow looks blue or your sunset looks dull? That's White Balance. Your camera tries to guess what 'white' looks like under different lights. We show you how to manually set your White Balance (using Kelvin) to ensure the colors in your photo match the beauty of what your eyes actually saw in the field." },
            { id: 10, title: "Leading Lines & Symmetry", cat: "Art", time: "14 min", content: "Architecture like the Holy Island boatsheds or the Kielder Observatory offer perfect opportunities for symmetry. Leading lines are paths, fences, or shorelines that pull the viewer's eye into the photo. Mastering these shapes is what separates a snapshot from a piece of fine art photography." },

                                        When you are out in the field in Northumberland—perhaps standing on the windswept dunes of Bamburgh or under the pitch-black skies of Kielder—this theory becomes reality. You need to adjust your settings based on the rapid shifts in weather. If the clouds break, your exposure values must change instantly. We recommend practicing this technique at least 50 times in different lighting conditions until it becomes muscle memory.

                                        <li>Always check your histogram after the first shot to ensure the bright North Sea sky hasn't lost all detail.</li>

                                        <li>Use a remote shutter or the 2-second timer to ensure your hand touching the camera doesn't cause blur.</li>
                                        <li>If shooting wildlife on the Farnes, keep your shutter speed twice as fast as you think you need.</li>
