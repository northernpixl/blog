It is the closest distance at which a lens can be focused while keeping objects at infinity acceptably sharp. When you focus at the hyperfocal distance, your depth of field extends from half that distance all the way to the horizon. \n\nWHY IT MATTERS: If you focus on the horizon, your foreground rocks will be soft. If you focus on the rocks, the castle in the background will be blurry. Hyperfocal is the mathematical middle ground.\n\nDETAILED STEPS:\n1. Compose your shot (e.g., rocks in front, castle in back).\n2. Determine your focal length (e.g., 24mm) and aperture (e.g., f/11).\n3. Use an app (PhotoPills) to find the number (e.g., 1.7 meters).\n4. Switch lens to Manual Focus.\n5. Focus on an object roughly 1.7m away (or use the distance scale on the lens).\n6.

Photography is 10% shooting and 90% observation.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n- Ducks: Before a duck flies, it often dips its head rapidly and shakes its body.\n- Raptors: Birds of prey (Ospreys) usually poop immediately before taking off. If you see this, get your finger on the shutter!\n- Hares: In March, they 'box'. This usually happens when a male chases a female and she turns to rebuff him.",

                fundamentals: "To keep stars sharp as the Earth rotates, you must limit your shutter speed. There are two main ways to calculate this:\n\n1. THE 500 RULE (Classic)\nFormula: 500 ÷ Focal Length = Max Seconds.\n- Example (24mm): 500 ÷ 24 = 20 seconds.\n- Pros: Easy to calculate in your head.\n- Cons: Designed for film/older cameras. On modern high-resolution sensors (24MP+), it often results in slight star trailing.\n\n2. THE NPF RULE (Pro Standard)\nFormula: Complex (considers aperture, pixel pitch, and declination).\n- Accuracy: It is far stricter. For that same 24mm lens, it might suggest 13 seconds instead of 20.\n- Usage: Don't do the math yourself. Use free 'NPF Calculators' available online or in apps like PhotoPills.\n\nVERDICT: Use the 500 Rule for social media. Use the NPF Rule for large prints.",
                impact: "Choosing the right rule ensures the stars appear as sharp, brilliant pinpricks of light rather than short dashes, which is critical for clarity in the Milky Way core.",
                proTip: "If you don't have an NPF calculator handy, a safe middle ground for modern cameras is the '400 Rule' (400 ÷ Focal Length)."

Turn on 'Live View' (LCD Screen).\n3. Point camera at the brightest star available (or a distant streetlamp).\n4. Use the digital zoom button (+) to zoom in 10x on the screen.\n5. Gently rotate focus ring until the star is as small and sharp as possible.\n6. If it looks like a donut, you are out of focus.",
                impact: "Focus is the single most common failure point in astro. A slightly blurry star ruins the entire image. Precise focus brings out faint stars that blurred focus would hide.",

Long Exposure Noise Reduction (In Camera): Takes a 'dark frame' after the shot to subtract hot pixels. Doubles shooting time.\n2. Stacking (Post): Take 10 identical photos and blend them in software (Sequator/Starry Landscape Stacker) to average out the random noise.",

All other stars rotate around this point.\n2. Settings: ISO 400, f/4, 30 seconds.\n3. Quantity: You need to take continuous shots for at least 1 hour (approx 120 photos).\n4. Intervalometer: Set your remote to take a photo every 31 seconds (giving 1 second for saving).\n5. Post: Software (StarStaX) layers them all into one image.",

Time: Scroll the timeline to 2 AM.\n3. Azimuth: Look for the grey dots (Milky Way). Align them with the castle.\n4. Moon: Ensure the Moon phase is near 0% (New Moon).
