The classic shot is from the 'Greystones' (round boulders) on the north side at Embleton Bay. \n\nCOMPOSITION: Long exposure (1-2 seconds) is essential here to smooth the often rough water washing over the round stones. The castle ruins form a jagged silhouette that looks best when backlit at sunrise.", parking: "NE66 3TW (Craster Quarry)", best_time: "Sunrise (Year-round)", top_tip: "The round stones are incredibly slippery when wet. Wear spikes or move very slowly to avoid a camera-breaking fall.", history: "Built in 1313 by Earl Thomas of Lancaster on a magnificent scale, seemingly to defy King Edward II.

Another option is the small stone jetty which points directly at the castle.", parking: "TD15 2RX (Chare Ends)", best_time: "Sunrise or Golden Hour", top_tip: "Always check the safe crossing times on the gov.uk website. The causeway floods rapidly and cars get stranded every year.", history: "A 16th-century fort built using stones from the dissolved priory.

The white lighthouse is a stark contrast to the dark rocks. \n\nCOMPOSITION: The causeway itself is a perfect leading line.

It also hosts thousands of Puffins. Because you are on a moving boat, image stabilization (IS/VR) is critical. Keep your shutter speed high.", parking: "NE65 0AP (Amble)", best_time: "Summer Breeding Season", top_tip: "Use a high shutter speed (1/1000s+) even for static shots, as the boat engine vibration will blur your images at slower speeds.", history: "Home to the ruins of a medieval Benedictine cell.

Bring a head net and Smidge repellent, or you won't be able to stand still long enough for a shot.", history: "Europe's largest man-made lake, created in 1981.

While you can't always shoot through their telescopes, the architecture of the observatory itself makes a stunning foreground for wide-angle Milky Way shots. \n\nTECH: Use a fast wide angle (14mm f/2.8). The deck faces South, perfect for the galactic core.", parking: "NE48 1EJ (Permit required at night)", best_time: "New Moon (Winter)", top_tip: "Use a red headtorch.

A deep lake sits in a former quarry with steep cliffs blocking light pollution. \n\nCOMPOSITION: The lake is incredibly still at night, offering perfect star reflections. Hadrian's Wall runs along the top of the crags—try illuminating it gently with a torch (light painting) during your exposure.", parking: "NE49 9PJ", best_time: "Clear Winter Nights", top_tip: "It's very exposed. Hang your camera bag on your tripod hook to weigh it down and prevent wind-shake during long exposures.", history: "A former dolerite quarry cut directly into the Whin Sill.

The best view for photographers is not from the entrance, but from the 'Lion Bridge' across the River Aln. \n\nCOMPOSITION: Frame the castle through the arches of the bridge or use the river as a leading line. The daffodils on the bank in spring create a yellow carpet foreground.", parking: "NE66 1YU", best_time: "Late Afternoon / Golden Hour", top_tip: "Arrive very early (pre-9 AM) or stay late. During the day, the bridge is full of tourists which makes clean architectural shots impossible.", history: "The seat of the Duke of Northumberland and the Percy family for over 700 years.

You don't want to be hauling a heavy gear bag up the escarpment only to be too tired to shoot.", history: "Vercovicium (Housesteads) was built around 124 AD.

The fine sand will get into your sensor immediately. Pick a focal length and stick with it.", history: "Part of the modern regeneration of the Blyth coastline.

It requires a 1.5-mile walk to reach. \n\nCOMPOSITION: You need a tripod and an ND filter. A shutter speed of 0.5s to 1s is perfect to blur the water while keeping texture. There is a plunge pool at the bottom that swirls—great for long exposure spirals.", parking: "NE66 4LZ (Hartside Farm)", best_time: "Overcast / After Rain", top_tip: "The path can be boggy.

The bridge below (Twizell Bridge) is also medieval and worth a shot.", parking: "TD15 2PS", best_time: "Mist/Fog", top_tip: "It looks best in black and white. The stark stone walls and empty windows lend themselves to a high-contrast, moody monochrome edit.", history: "Begun in 1770 by Sir Francis Blake, but never completed.
